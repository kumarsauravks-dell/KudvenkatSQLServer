-Primary Key
	-used to unequely identify each record in a table.
	
- Create a table graphically
	- expand database -> expand table -> 
		-> right click on Table folder -> New ->Table
		-> enter record -> column name ,data type -> right click on left most symbol -> set primary key
		-> right click on tab top -> Save Table1 -> Give Name+Enter

- Create a table using query
	create table tblGender(
	Id int not null primary key,
	Gender nvarchar(50) not null
	)

- insert data using the designer
	- Right click on the table -> Edit Top 200 Rows

- To force database integity we use foreign key relationship.
	- If we make the GenderId as foreign key in tblPerson table, it will not accept a value which is not defined in tblGender table like 99.

- Set foreign key graphically 
	Right click on table -> Design -> Left most to the column -> right click and select Relationships ->  Add -> Table and column specification
	-> Set the primary key column, foreign key column 

- Set foreign key using query
	alter table tblPerson add constraint tblPerson_GenderId_FK foreign key (GenderId) references tblGender(Id)

- Default constraint
	If a column can accept null value, in case if we dont want to store null when no value is supplied , we can give it av default value
	eg : alter table tblPerson add constraint DF_tblPerson_GenderId default 3 for GenderId
	Note : If you dont supply a value for GenderId then only it will assign a default value , if you intentianally set null value to it then it will assign null and not the default value 3, it will work only if you miss to supply a value .

- Adding a new column , with default value to an exisiting table.
	alter table TABLENAME add COLUMNNAME DATATYPE NULL|NOT NULL CONSTRAINTNAME default DEFAULTVALUE

- Dropping a constraint
	alter table TABLENAME drop constraint CONSTRAINTNAME

- Cascading Referential Integrity
	-tblPerson has a foreign key of GenderId , what if we delete the record from tblGender which is refering to tblPerson 
	-we have four options in this case
		- No Action -> Delete/Update is rolled back
		- Casacade -> all rows containing those foreign key are also deleted or updated.
		- Set Null -> all rows containing those foreign key are set to null.
		- Set Default -> all rows containing those foreign key are set to default value defined in default constraint.

	-how to set one of these options
		Right click on tblPerson -> expand the Keys folder -> Right click on foreign key -> Modify -> Insert and Update specification -> change the delete and update rule.

- Check constraint graphically
	- to add a check constraint -> Right click on the constraint folder inside the table -> New constraint
		-> in the Expession , write the condition like : Age>0 And Age<150
		-> Save 
		-> If we will intentianally inserting null , check constraint will not work and data will get inserted.

- Check constraint using query
	- alter table TABLENAME add constraint CONSTRAINTNAME check BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION
	- alter table tblEmp add constraint CK_tblEmp_Age check (Age>0 and Age<150)

- Identity column
	- how to check if a column is an identity column?
		Right click on the column -> Select Properties -> Identity (true/false)
	- set a column to be an identity column
		-using the designer 
			Select the column -> Modify -> In Column Properties window -> Identity Spectification -> set Is Identity to True, Identity Increment to 1, Identity Seed to 1
		-using Query
			PId int identity(1,1) primary key

- Reuse the old id if deleted in identity column
	Normally if an id is deleted it is not reused when a new record is inserted , to reuse it:
	- set identity_insert tblPerson1 on
	- insert into tblPerson1(PId,Name) values (1,'Martha')
	- Note : Once identity_insert is on we cant able to insert like : insert into tblPerson1 values ('Mary')
				But to do so we have to set identity_insert tblPerson1 off

- Delete all the record from a table
	query :- delete from tblPerson1
	- after deletion of all records when we insert a new record it start just after the last identity value.
		to correct it we can use query :- dbcc checkident(tblPerson1,reseed,0)

	
- Difference between SCOPE_IDENTITY() and @@IDENTITY 
	- SCOPE_IDENTITY() -> returns the last generated identity of same session and same scope.
		same session means jo connection hum open kiye matlab New Query window . Same scope means main scope koi sub scope nhi.
	- @@IDENTITY -> returns the last identity of same session across any scope.
		any scope means sub ya last inserted record ka scope.
	- IDENT_CURRENT('TableName') - specific table across any session and any scope.

- Unique key 
	kisi column k uniqueness k liye hum primary key ya unique key ko use krte hain.
	kisi table me Id , email , pan_number sare column ko uniqune hi rhna chaiye but ek se jada primary key nhi ho skte ek table me , isliye aur sare unique key.
	primary key does not allow any null but unique key has only one null.

	- set unique key using designer
		Right click on table -> Design -> Select any column -> Indexes/Keys -> Add -> Set Columns : column , Type : Unique Key , Name : UQ_tableName_ColumnName 

	- set unique key using query
		alter table tblEmp1 add constraint UQ_tblEmp1_Phone Unique(Phone)

	- delete unique key constraint 
		alter table tblEmp1 drop constraint UQ_tblEmp1_Phone

		select * from tblPerson where City!='London'

		select * from tblPerson where Age = 20 or Age = 23 or Age = 29 
		select * from tblPerson where Age in  (20,23,29)

		select * from tblPerson where Age BETWEEN 20 And 25

		select * from tblPerson where City like 'L%'
		select * from tblPerson where Email not like'%@%'

    - wild cards in Sql
		% -> any number of character eg: like %@%
		_ -> exactly one character eg: like _@_ 
		[] -> should start with M,S,T eg: like '[MST]%'
		[^] -> should not start with M,S,T eg: like '[^MST]%'

    - joining multiple constraints using AND and OR operators
		select * from tblPerson where (City = 'London' or City = 'Mumbai') AND Age > 25

    - sorting rows using order by
		select * from tblPerson order by Name -> sorting names in alphabatical order
		select * from tblPerson order by Name DESC
		select * from tblPerson order by Name DESC, Age DESC -> Jab 2 ya 2 se jada same name milega to uska sorting age k hisab se hoga.

    - selecting top n or top n percentage of rows 
		select top 10 * from tblPerson
		select top 10 Name,Age from tblPerson
		select top 1 Percent * from tblPerson
		select top 1 * from tblPerson order by Age DESC

	- aggregate function 
		select Sum(Salary) from tblEmployee
		select Min(Salary) from tblEmployee
		select Max(Salary) from tblEmployee

	- group by clause can be used with aggregate function
		- select totalsalary of employees city wise( group by single column)
			select City,Sum(Salary) as TotalSalary from tblEmp2 group by City 
		- select total salary of employees city wise as well as gender wise(group by multiple columns)
			select City, Gender, Sum(salary) as TotalSalary from tblEmp2 group by City,Gender order by City
		- select total salary,total employees city wise as well as gender wise
			select City, Gender, Sum(salary) as TotalSalary,COUNT(id) as NumberOfEmployees from tblEmp2 group by City,Gender order by city,gender
		- Note : to add spaces in column namewe can use [] like [Number of Employees]

		- having is used to filter the data, same as where clause but is used after the group by clause.
			select City, Gender, Sum(salary) as TotalSalary,COUNT(id) as NumberOfEmployees from tblEmp2 group by City,Gender Having Gender='Male'

		- we can not use aggregate function with where clause like
			select * from tblEmp2 where Sum(Salary) > 4000
		
		-  summary
			- where can be used with select,insert and update statements, having can be only used with select statement.
			- where filters rows before aggregation(Grouping) , having groups after aggregation.
			- aggregate function can not be used in where clause unless it is in a sub query contained in a having clause, aggregate functions can be used in having clause.

	- Joins -> are used to retrieve data from 2 or more related tables. In general tables are related to each other using foreign key constraints.
	- Inner Join -> returns only the matching rowsbetween both the tables. Non matching rows are eliminated.
	- query to join employee and department to show DepartmentName Against employee
		select Name,Gender,Salary,DepName from tableEmployee join tableDepartment on tableEmployee.DepartmentId=tableDepartment.Id

	- Left Join -> returns all the matching rows + non matching rows from the left table

		select Name,Gender,Salary,DepName from tableEmployee left join tableDepartment on tableEmployee.DepartmentId=tableDepartment.Id

	- Right Join -> returns all the matching rows + non matching rows from the right table.
	- query to join employee and department to show the matching and non matching rows from department table
		select Name,Gender,Salary,DepName from tableEmployee right join tableDepartment on tableEmployee.DepartmentId=tableDepartment.Id

	- Full Join -> returns all rows from both the left and right tables, including the non mathing rows.

	- Cross Join -> produces the cartesian product of the two tables involved in the join
		if employee table has 10rows and department table has 4 rows , cross join will produce 40 rows.
		cross join does not have on clause
		select Name,Gender,Salary,DepName from tableEmployee cross join tableDepartment

		select isnull('Pragim','No Manager') as Manager

		select E.Name as Employee,isnull(M.Name,'No Manager') as Manager from tableEmployee1 E left join tableEmployee1 M on E.ManagerId=M.EmployeeId
    
	- Case statement
		select E.Name as Employee,case when M.Name is null then 'No Manager' else M.Name end as Manager from tableEmployee1 E left join tableEmployee1 M on E.ManagerId=M.EmployeeId

    - COALESCE() function
		- Similar to isnull
			select E.Name as Employee,coalesce(M.Name,'No Manager') as Manager from tableEmployee1 E left join tableEmployee1 M on E.ManagerId=M.EmployeeId

		- Returns the first non null value.
			select Id , coalesce(FirstName,MiddleName,LastName) as Name from tableEmployee2

	Union and Union All	
		- operators used to combine result set of two or more select queries.
		- the number,data types, order of columns in the select statement need to be the same
		select * from tblIndCustomers union select * from tblUkCustomers
		select * from tblIndCustomers union all select * from tblUkCustomers

		- union removes duplicare records, whereas union all doesnt.
		- union has to perform distinct sort to remove duplicates, which makes it less faster than union all.

		- Difference between Union and Join
			Union combines rows from 2 or more tables, whereas Joins combine columns from 2 or more tables.

	Stored Procedures
		- is a group of T-Sql(Transact SQL) statement. 
		when we want to execute same piece of query again and again we can use a sp and we can call it by name only.

		-query to create a sp
			create proc sp_getEmployee
			as
			begin
			select Name,Gender from tblEmployee
			end

		- check if the sp got created
			Expand the Database -> Programability -> Stored Procedures

		- sp with parameters 
			create proc sp_getEmployeeByDepIdGender
			@DepId int,
			@Gender nvarchar(10)
			as 
			begin
			select * from tblEmployee where Gender=@Gender AND DepId=@DepId
			end

		- We have to remember the order of parameter or we have to pass the values with parameter name.

		- check the text of sp
			right click on sp -> Script Stored Procedures -> Create To -> New Query Editor window
			query -> sp_helptext proc_name

		- delete a procedure
			drop proc proc_name

		- encrypt a sp
			alter proc sp_getEmployee
			with encryption
			as
			begin
			select Name,Gender from tblEmployee
			end

		- sp with output parameter
			- to create sp wih output parameter , we use keyword out or output.
			- if we dont specify the output keyword, when executig sp the variable will be null
			query
				create proc spEmployeeByGender 
				@Gender nvarchar(20),
				@Count int out
				as
				begin
					select @Count= Count(Id) from tblEmployee where Gender=@Gender
				end

				declare @EmpCount int
				exec spEmployeeByGender 'Male',@EmpCount output
				print @EmpCount

		- useful system stored Procedures
			- sp_help proc_name -> we can et te name,type and parameters of sp
				sortcut -> Alt+F1 , can be used with tables too.
			- sp_helptext proc_name -> text of sp
			- sp_depends proc_name -> to wic table te sp depends,can be used with table too.

		- Difference b/n output parameter and return value
			- When we right click a sp and select Execute Stored Procedure -> it will return two values ,it returns an intger status variable, usually zero indicates success and non zero indicates failure. 
			- output parameter query
				create proc spGetEmpCount 
				@EmpCount int output
				as
				begin
					select @EmpCount = count(Id) from tblEmployee
				end

				declare @TotalEmp int
				exec spGetEmpCount @TotalEmp out
				print @TotalEmp

			- return value query
				create proc spGetEmpCount1
				as
				begin
					return (select count(Id) from tblEmployee)
				end

				declare @TotalCount int
				exec @TotalCount = spGetEmpCount1
				print @TotalCount

			- output parameter to print string value
				create proc empNameById1
				@Id int,
				@Name nvarchar(20) output
				as
				begin 
					select @Name = Name from tblEmployee where Id=@Id
				end

				declare @Name nvarchar(20) 
				execute empNameById1 1,@Name out
				print 'Name : '+@Name

			- return value to print string value
				create proc empNameById2
				@Id int
				as
				begin
					return (select Name from tblEmployee where Id=@Id)
				end

				declare @N nvarchar(20)
				exec @N=empNameById2 1
				print @N

				Note: It will throw an error because return value can only return one digit integer and not string.

			- summary 
			Return State Value 		output parameters
			only int data type		any datatype 
			only one value 			more than one also
			used to conver success 	use to return values 
			 or failure				 like name,count etc.

Three types of User Defined Function
- Scalar functions
- Inline table valued functions
- Multi-statement table valued functions

Scalar functions
- may/may not have parameters but always return a single(scalar) value.
	return value can be of any datatype expect text,ntext,image,cursor,timestamp
- We can not use stored procedures in a select or where clause. Function have this ability.
- To see the content of scalar function we use sp_helptext
- To alter a function use Alter function function_name
- To delete a function use drop function function_name

Inline Table valued function 
- returns a table.
- we specify the table as return type instead of any scalar datatype.
- function body is not enclosed between Begin and End blocks.
- the structure of the able tahat gets returned is determined by the select statement within the function.
- can be used to achieve the functionality of parameterised views.
- table returned can also be used in joins with other tables.

Multi-Statement Table Valued function
- We specify the the structure of the table that gets returned.
- It has Begin and End blocks.
- Always prefer to use ITV functions over MSTV functions
- Its possible to update the underlying table using ITV functions, but not possible with MSTV functions.

-----------------------------------
#Ref Video 33
Deterministic functions
- always returnssame result anytime they are called with a specific set of input values and gives the same state of the database.
	eg: Square(),Power(),Sum(),Avg(),Count() etc.

Nondeterministic functions
- may return different values each time they are called with a specific set of input values even if the database state that they access remains the same.
	eg: GetDate(),CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

Rand() function
- is non deterministic function , but if the seed value is provided it becomes deterministic

Encrypting a function
- Use WithEncryption to encrypt the text of function

Schema Binding option
- specifies that function is bound to the database object that it references.
- when this option is specified,the base object cannot be modified in any way that would affect the function defination.
-the function defination must be dropped to remove dependencies on the object that is to be modified.
- Use WITHSCHEMABINDING
