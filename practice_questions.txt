    Show Joins like Inner Join, Left Outer Join , Right Outer Join , Full Outer Join ,  Cross Join.
    Write the query to select the non matching records from employee table, department table and also from both the tables.

    - ISNULL , Case statement and COALESCE

Q13. Create a table tableEmployee2 like :-
